## What is a Monorepo?<a name="what-is-a-monorepo"></a>

A *monorepo* (monolithic repository) is a single code repository that contains multiple projects or services. This approach helps in:

- Sharing code easily between modules
- Consistent tooling and configuration
- Simplified dependency management
- Easier cross-project changes
- Unified CI/CD pipelines

## Structure<a name="structure"></a>

This repository includes multiple related services and apps under one roof:

## How to Use Pre-Commit<a name="how-to-use-pre-commit"></a>

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to maintain code quality and consistency.
Pre-commit is a tool that runs automated checks called hooks before each commit.
These hooks are defined in the [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file and can include linting, formatting, and security scans.

### Installation<a name="installation"></a>

This sets up a Git hook that automatically runs checks before each commit. If any check fails, the commit is blocked until the issue is fixed.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Running Pre-Commit Manually<a name="running-pre-commit-manually"></a>

You can run all configured hooks on every file in the repository (not just the ones you've staged) using:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This is especially useful when:

- You want to scan the entire codebase for issues.
- You're setting up pre-commit for the first time.
- Youâ€™ve made bulk changes and want to ensure everything passes the checks.
